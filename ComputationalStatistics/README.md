# Computational Statistics
This folder contains just one project carried out for the Computational Statistics exam.
The data set provides data for 569 patients on 30 features of the cell nuclei obtained from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) 
of a breast mass. For each patient the cancer was diagnosed as malignant or benign.

For the analysis it was required to use two of the methods explained during the course. Therefore, I decided to use the model-based clustering (usupervised) 
based on finite mixtures and the model-based classification considering as model-based classifiers the EDDA (Eigenvalue Decomposition Discriminant Analysis) and
the MDA (Mixture Discriminant Analysis).
